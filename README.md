# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

The first step is installation, to install type

### `yarn` or `npm install`

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

## Improvements to this assignment

1. Consolidate all items into one single list instead of three tables by currency and then use dropdown filtering to filter by currency and filter by type of product
2. Implement sorting on all columns of data
3. Replace html table with divs
4. Write unit tests for the functions
5. Implement better styling
6. Note:I had to edit the do-not-refactor files to add an export line at the top , in a real project the data would possibly be available from an API and consuming it would happen through async calls using redux/hooks
7. Hosting it in a service like Netlify
